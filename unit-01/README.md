## SWBATs

### Ruby Review


+ Recall basic Ruby syntax
+ Assign a variable to different data types
+ Call built-in Ruby methods and define their own methods
+ Understand and use arrays and hashes to organize data
+ Use methods to iterate through and manipulate data structures
+ Create classes and use attr_accessors to access data

### MVC

+ MODEL - Understand what a model is
+ MODELS - Build a model with attributes and actions
+ MODELS - Understand what attr_accessors are and how to use them
+ SINATRA - Understand why we use the MVC file structure and how models fit into it
+ CONTROLLERS - Understand why we need controllers (to set up routes and connect data from models to views)
+ CONTROLLLERS - Build GET request routes
+ CONTROLLERS - Connect specific routes to erb templates
+ CONTROLLERS - Connect information from models to views via controller and instance variables
+ VIEW - Understand how to create an erb template file (and how it is similar to an HTML file)
+ VIEWS - Understand what the `yield` statement in layout.erb does and why we use it
+ VIEWS - Understand why we  use instance variables in our views
+ VIEW - Understand how to use erb tags and instance variables to display dynamic information in views
+ SINATRA - Boot up server via rackup and run their app
+ SINATRA - Understand why we need a config.ru file
+ SINATRA - Understand what goes into the public folder, gemfile and config folder (environment configurations)
+ NB - Must use rackup (as opposed to shotgun) for this demo (shotgun restarts server every time page is refreshed and tweets disappear)
